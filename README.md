# React Structure Proposal

This proposal aims to keep the structure organised by preventing **deep** and **complex** nested folder arrangement for React and React Native Projects. Moreover, it also brings the benefit of **modularisation**, since we can move sections to screens (if they get too deep) and also keeps the **state management** close to where they live.
